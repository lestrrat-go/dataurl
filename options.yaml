      EncodeOption is a type of option that can be passed to Encode()
options:
  - ident: Base64Encoding
    interface: EncodeOption
    argument_type: bool
    comment: |
      WithBase64Encoding specifies if the payload should or should not
      be base64 encoded. Specifying this option overrides the automatic
      detection that is performed by default, where any payload without
      an explciit `text/****` media type will be base64 encoded
  - ident: MediaType
    interface: EncodeOption
    argument_type: string
    comment: |
      WithMediaType allows users to specify an explciit media type for the
      data to be encoded.
      
      If unspecified, `"net/http".DetectContentType` will be used to sniff
      the media type.
      
      You may include parameters (e.g. `charset=utf-8`) in this string as well,
      but it is the caller's responsibility to make sure that it is well-formed.
  - ident: MediaTypeParams
    interface: EncodeOption
    argument_type: map[string]string
    comment: |
      WithMediaTypeParams allows users to provide extra media type parameters,
      such as `charset=utf-8` as a map.
      
      Upon any conflict, values provided in this map will overwrite the
      values found in the media type string provided either explcitly by the
      user or by auto-detection.

      It is the user's reponsibility to properly format the parameter names,
      such as properly making everything lower-case (or not).
